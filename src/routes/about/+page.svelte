            Spaced repetition flashcards are reviewed at increasing intervals to 
            ensure information enters your long term memory. As you answer cards right more frequently, the intervals increase. This means that as you review cards,
            your daily review count will slowly decrease, allowing you to memorise thousands of things with minutes of daily effort.

        <h2 class="text-4xl mb-1 mt-1.5">Flashcard formatting</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">Anki & AnkiDroid support powerful flashcard formatting. Cards are rendered in HTML, allowing for custom markup, and they even support LaTeX equations. However,
            all formatting is opt-in. If you prefer, you can create cards containing only plain text.
